# AZNK

> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT DOWNLOAD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A developing auto personnal account management tool for Azur Lane

Plan to finish it during summer holiday because of tons of homework now

## For PC

Some requirements for using itï¼š(http://www.lsplayer.com/#/) an android simulator, and set it full screen

Why it? AZNK is being developed using this simulator so there's no guarantee that it'll work if the environment has changed

and your scrren should be 1920*1080 and there should be no resize like 125% enlarge or whatever

That's all for the requirements. But some requiring software are not packed, so DONT DOWNLOAD NOW!!!!!!!!!

Hopefully, this NeKo playing Azur Lane will be released during August!

Thanks for reading this article and looking forward to your love for this kitten.(NeKo means cats, or kitten in English)
